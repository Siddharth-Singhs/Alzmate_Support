# Alzmate

### Inspiration
Our team saw an opportunity to work in medical field. We thought working on some areas in it. Then we came across this disease called Alzheimer. We saw some research papers regarding the disease and found that if this disease is found in its early stages then through proper care it can help improve the condition of the patient. So we came across this idea of that can do something for those people. We have built dedicated app for patient and his caretaker.

### What it does
It has its sections: Reminder Section ** : In this section we have daily reminder page where patients can read his daily reminder given to him by the caretaker. **People You Know: This section has all the details about the patient friend/relatives . Its like the database that our recognizer that can recognize and identify the person. Patient in one shot can check all the details of the people added.But there's a catch . This section can only be updated by Caretaker to ensure the correctness of it. Camera This section has the recognition that uses azure's faceapi for identification of the person using built-in camera. This helps the patient in help remembering the friends/relatives name. People in this section is added by the caretaker ny his respective app. My journal In This section we added the diary kind like feature so patient can have his own journal maintained. Chat Chat is implemented to chat between patient and caretaker.

### How we built it
We used Android for development of app and Firebase for database purposes. For face recognition we used Faceapi provided by Microsoft Azure.

### Challenges we ran into
There were many challenges faced: 
<br> 1.Many challenges were regarding android. From crashes to making up camera work. To make framelayout smooth and make user experience better. </br>
<br> 2.There was problem regrading faceapi, we couldn't get it to authenticate using token. But somehow we made it work. </br>

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
This app itself is the accomplishment that we are proud of. We want to make something that could really help patients with alzheimer. To some extent we have done a good job.

### What we learned
There are many things we learned in our path while working on this project. From teamwork to bug fixing. Learned new technologies like firebase and Azure Api.

### What's next for Alzmate
